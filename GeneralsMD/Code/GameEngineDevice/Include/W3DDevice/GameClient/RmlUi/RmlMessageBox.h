// FILE: RmlMessageBox.h ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// RmlUiMessageBoxHook handler backing MessageBoxOk/YesNo/OkCancel/etc. and the
// quit confirmation boxes (see GameWindowManager::gogoMessageBox). Unlike
// RmlOptionsScreen, this is not a single reused RmlScreen: gogoMessageBox can
// be called reentrantly (an Ok callback can itself pop a new message box
// before the first one's own close finishes -- see PopupReplay::reallySaveReplay
// for a real example), so instances are heap-allocated and stacked, each
// owning its own RmlUi document and data model so they render one above the
// other and close independently and in the order they were opened.
