// Widget-agnostic script popup message logic: taking over what the script asked for, going modal
// while the game is paused, and dismissing it with OK, Enter or Escape. InGamePopupMessage.cpp's
// .wnd callbacks and RmlInGamePopupScreen call these instead of duplicating the rules.

	// the game, makes window (the .wnd's parent, or the placeholder standing in for the RmlUi popup)
	// modal so the other windows stop taking the mouse. FALSE if the script has none.

	// Enter and Escape dismiss it, on the key coming up. Returns TRUE for both states of those keys,
