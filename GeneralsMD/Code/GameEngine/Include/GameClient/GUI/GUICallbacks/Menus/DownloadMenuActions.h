// Widget-agnostic download screen logic: the download manager that reports the update's file, size,
// status and progress into DownloadMenuData (emitting DownloadMenuSignals::changed()), and what the
// player does about it (cancel). DownloadMenu.cpp's .wnd callbacks and RmlDownloadScreen call these
// instead of duplicating the rules.

	// to report to. layout is what closes with the screen; null if there is nothing to tear down.

	// Refreshes the time left about once a second (not in Generals Online builds, which show none).
