// FILE: DisconnectMenuActions.h /////////////////////////////////////////////
// Widget-agnostic disconnect screen logic: what the disconnect manager reports (names, timeouts,
// votes, chat) and what the player does about it (vote, quit, chat), changing DisconnectMenuData.
// DisconnectMenu feeds the reports in; DisconnectWindow.cpp's .wnd callbacks and
// RmlDisconnectScreen call the player's actions instead of duplicating the rules.
