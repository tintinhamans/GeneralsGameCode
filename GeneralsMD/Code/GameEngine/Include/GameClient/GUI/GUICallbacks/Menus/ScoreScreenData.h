// FILE: ScoreScreenData.h ////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Widget-agnostic score screen content: what the score screen displays for every
// mode (single player, skirmish, LAN, internet, replay), with no GameWindow/gadget
// coupling. ScoreScreen.cpp's grabMultiPlayerInfo()/grabSinglePlayerInfo() build
// this once per screen entry and fill their .wnd gadgets from it, so a future
// non-.wnd front end (e.g. RmlUi) can build the same data and render it itself.
//
// Building this data can have the same side effects ScoreScreen.cpp has always had
// on screen entry (battle honor writes, online stats posting): call build* exactly
// once per screen entry, same as today.
