// FILE: DirectConnectActions.h /////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Widget-agnostic LAN direct-connect actions: host/join/remote-IP-history/name-
// commit, with the exact behavior NetworkDirectConnect.cpp's callbacks have
// always had. No GameWindow/gadget coupling, so NetworkDirectConnect.cpp and a
// future RmlUi front end drive the same TheLAN calls through these functions
// instead of duplicating the logic. Same duplication precedent as
// LanLobbyActions.h. Moved from HostDirectConnectGame()/JoinDirectConnectGame()/
// UpdateRemoteIPList()/NetworkDirectConnectInit()/NetworkDirectConnectSystem()'s
// ButtonBack case.

	// nextToken-before-'(' + sscanf as the original; an unparsable address still proceeds with
	// whatever sscanf partially filled, matching the .wnd path's DEBUG_ASSERTCRASH-only handling),
	// writes UserName pref, updates the remote-IP history (see updateRemoteIPList()), sends the
	// (length-truncated) name, then RequestGameJoinDirectConnect(). comboEntries/currentSelection are

	// when currentText doesn't match any existing entry (a freshly typed address), matching
	// GadgetComboBoxGetSelectedPos()'s -1-on-no-match behavior. A currentText that isn't a valid
	// "a.b.c.d..." address leaves everything unchanged (no prefs write), same as the original's early

	// enumerate its own combobox to build comboEntries.
